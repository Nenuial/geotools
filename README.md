The goal of geotools is to provide simple support functions. They are mainly used in my {[geographer](https://github.com/Nenuial/geographer)} package.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of geotools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("Nenuial/geotools")
```

Or from r-universe:

``` r
install.packages('geographer', repos = c('https://nenuial.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```

## Documentation

The package documentation is available at [https://geotools.nenuial.org](https://geotools.nenuial.org).
